# Multiple-Year-Stock-Data
## VBA Challenge of UCI Bootcamp

In the first step, I created a script that would loop through each year of stock data and grab the total volume each stock had over the year.

I also, displayed the ticker symbol to coincide with the total volume.

After doing the above steps, in the second step, I created a script that would loop through all the stocks and take the following info:

•	Yearly change from what the stock opened the year at to what the closing price was.

•	The percent change from what it opened the year at to what it closed.

•	The total volume of the stock

•	Ticker symbol


I added conditional formatting that will highlight positive changes in green and negative changes in red.

In the last step, I located the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume" and entered the information in the specified columns.
